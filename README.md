# Nested-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Project Scope: To perform a nested Monte Carlo Simulation for better utilization of computational budget for portfolio optimization.  
Tasks Completed:  
•	Developed and programmed 2 Nested Monte Carlo simulation algorithms for computational budget allocation - equal allocation and dynamic allocation based on changes in expected in value-at-risk.  
•	Compared results of the nested simulation for change in portfolio weight of  AAPL ETF by leveraging real world equity market data with results presented in ‘A Nested Simulation Optimization Approach for Portfolio Selection’ by Lin , Zhou and Megahed (2020).
